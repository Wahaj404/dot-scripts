# dot-scripts

Collection of small scripts I use on linux.

## Usage:

Clone the repo into your home directory in a folder named .scripts:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Wahaj404/dot-scripts.git ~/.scripts
```

The recurse-submodules switch is used to initilize the resources for the scripts which come from their own repositories.

You can also add all scripts to path for easier access. Simply add `PATH=~/.scripts:$PATH` to your shell's rc file (e.g. ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc);
